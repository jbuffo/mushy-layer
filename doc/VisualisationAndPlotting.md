# Visualisation and plotting Chombo data

For quick visualisation, [Visit](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/source) is a good option.

For making plots, we include matlab code at `/matlab/ChomboMatlab/`. An example script can be found at `/matlab/ChomboMatlab/PlottingExample.m`.

There is also python code at `/plotting/` along with an example in `/plotting/PlottingExample.py`
